The primary aim of this project is to build a machine learning model that can detect Parkinson’s disease based on extracted vocal features. The system will accept audio input (voice samples), extract relevant features, and predict whether the sample indicates signs of Parkinson’s disease.

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement, speech, and motor control. Early detection is critical for managing symptoms and slowing progression, but current diagnostic methods are largely clinical and subjective, often relying on visible symptoms that appear after substantial neurological damage has occurred.

Research has shown that subtle changes in voice and speech patterns can be early indicators of Parkinson’s disease. These vocal biomarkers—such as jitter, shimmer, pitch, and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR)—can be quantified and analyzed using machine learning techniques to provide a non-invasive, cost-effective early screening tool.
